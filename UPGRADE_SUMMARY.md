## ⚠️ Notes & Known Issues

### Linting Warnings
The existing codebase has some ESLint warnings that are **not related to the upgrade**:
- Some `==` vs `===` issues
- Unused variables
- Missing v-for keys in some components
- Tab characters in some server files

These can be fixed with `npm run lint:fix` or manually.

### Tailwind CSS v4 Changes
- **Forms plugin**: The `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin hasn't been updated for v4 yet, but basic form styling still works through Tailwind's default styles
- **Container queries**: Now built into Tailwind v4 core (use `@container` utilities)
- **Configuration**: Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based configuration instead of JS config files
- **No ESLint plugin**: The `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` doesn't support v4 yet, so class ordering/validation is disabled for now

### Build Warnings
There are some sourcemap warnings from the Tailwind Vite plugin during build:
```
WARN [plugin @tailwindcss/vite:generate:build] Sourcemap is likely to be incorrect
```
These are **non-critical** and don't affect functionality.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test your application thoroughly** in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check all pages** to ensure Tailwind styles are rendering correctly

3. **Verify database migrations** still work if needed:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

4. **Fix linting issues** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

5. **Consider re-adding form styling** if needed:
   - Wait for `@tailwindcss/forms` to support v4, or
   - Add custom form styles in your Tailwind CSS file
